Current status:

- Can build empty.osm!
- Can build demo.osm!
    - Demo.osm can be loaded and its Echo script appears to work ok
        - But Dromed crashes when leaving game mode. Guess I need to debug why (and build debug version of the osm too)?
UGGGGGGGGGGh
    now building both release and debug versions of demo.osm
    Maybe if I attach vc++ now I can debug the crash (heap corruption??) ???
    Is it even worth it anymore???
